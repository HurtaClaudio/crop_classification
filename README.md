# Crop Classification with CNNs

1. Description of the dataset

Dataset contains 30 different types of crop images in separate folders

Although the dataset is very well curated and preprocessed, it still pose a challenge since the number of categories is fairly elevated (30) and we only have around 800 images to work with

  <img src="Agricultural-crops\soyabean\imaage (7).jpg" width="200" /> 
  <img src="Agricultural-crops\Tobacco-plant\image11.jpeg" width="200" />
</p>

The challenge will be to create a model usign only CNNs, no transfer learning nor heavy back bones, and try to get the highest accuracy possible.
